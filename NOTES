11.21.23:
- generated code from CubeMX and imported tinyusb library
- commit
- ported over tinyusb specific files from DISCO_MIDI
- update makefile include tinyusb sources/includes (used DISCO_MIDI as inspiration)
- // i2c buffer should be in separate source file, SPI??

11.26.23:
- continue developing spi and i2c functions for ADC and DAC
- buffers are being initialized in peripheral functions, do they need to be static??
- verify orientation of mode select pin
- check that all functions using GPIO pins are correctly swapped over from old code
- go over making SPI and I2C buffers static (unaffected between function calls)

11.28.23:
- https://www.radioshuttle.de/en/turtle-en/nucleo-st-link-interface-en/ //useful link for flashing board
- temporarily commented out all but midi task to test MIDIoverUSB

11.30.23: 
- test verified with PCB as MIDI USB Device!

12.4.23
- tested ADC/DAC --> DAC does not work
- adjusted hi2c1.Init.Timing to match DISCO project, yet to be tested (hopeful though)
