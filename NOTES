11.21.23:
- generated code from CubeMX and imported tinyusb library
- commit
- ported over tinyusb specific files from DISCO_MIDI
- update makefile include tinyusb sources/includes (used DISCO_MIDI as inspiration)
- // i2c buffer should be in separate source file, SPI??

11.26.23:
- continue developing spi and i2c functions for ADC and DAC
- buffers are being initialized in peripheral functions, do they need to be static??
- verify orientation of mode select pin
- check that all functions using GPIO pins are correctly swapped over from old code
- go over making SPI and I2C buffers static (unaffected between function calls)
