11.21.23:
- generated code from CubeMX and imported tinyusb library
- commit
- ported over tinyusb specific files from DISCO_MIDI
- update makefile include tinyusb sources/includes (used DISCO_MIDI as inspiration)
- // i2c buffer should be in separate source file, SPI??

11.26.23:
- continue developing spi and i2c functions for ADC and DAC
- buffers are being initialized in peripheral functions, do they need to be static??
- verify orientation of mode select pin
- check that all functions using GPIO pins are correctly swapped over from old code
- go over making SPI and I2C buffers static (unaffected between function calls)

11.28.23:
- https://www.radioshuttle.de/en/turtle-en/nucleo-st-link-interface-en/ //useful link for flashing board
- temporarily commented out all but midi task to test MIDIoverUSB

11.30.23: 
- test verified with PCB as MIDI USB Device!

12.4.23
- tested ADC/DAC --> DAC does not work
- adjusted hi2c1.Init.Timing to match DISCO project, yet to be tested (hopeful though)

12.5.23
- ADC, DAC and MIDI all working tentatively
- DAC works tentatively: will output a fixed value, also outputs keypress from ADC when 
    in debug, but does NOT work in real time just reading ADC and outputting to DAC 
    UNLESS MIDI is also enabled (could be a timing issue? while loop too fast? doesn't
    really make sense )
